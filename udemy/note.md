# How React Works

-   Build your own, custom HTML Elements
-   React is all about "Components"
-   React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JavaScript (and CSS)
-   Declarative Approach
-   Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions

# Why Components?

-   Reusability : Don't repeat yourself
-   Separation of Concerns : Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)
-   Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions
